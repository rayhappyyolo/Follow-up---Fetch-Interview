Customer Spending Analysis - Improved SQL and Insights

Project Overview：

This project shows my improved SQL and data analysis skills, based on feedback from the initial interview. I recreated a similar problem with sample data to demonstrate my progress and readiness for the next interview round.

Files in this Repository：

CTE.sql: SQL code using CTEs to improve readability and structure, as suggested in feedback.
Rui_Pan_Next_Round_Analysis.pdf: A PDF report with analysis results, visual insights, and recommendations.
output.csv: SQL query results used in Tableau for data visualization.
sample_data_2023_and_2024.csv: Sample dataset simulating customer transactions for 2023 and 2024.

Project Background：

In the first interview, I was asked to analyze customer spending to find “best customers” and trends. Using the feedback, I created a similar case to:

Analyze customer spending across 2023 and 2024.
Use CTEs to make SQL code clearer.
Visualize data in Tableau to give actionable insights.
